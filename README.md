## How to Use the App
A GitHub like application built using Angular 6. I have used Auth0 Library for authentication and authorization.

The features of the app are:

Login View - User is able to login to the system through his github account. Upon login, user will see his GitHub account.

User View - User can search for other users using the username in the search box. Details like profile picture, name, company, bio, followers, following, repos, gists etc are shown. Upon clicking on any of the repos or gists, the user will be able to see the code present in that repo or gists.
